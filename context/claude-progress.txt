2026-01-24: Fixed counter increment bug on toggle
- Root cause: removePostsFirstPass() re-processed collapsed posts when toggling enable/disable
- collapsePost() removed existing banner, recreated it → returned true → incremented counter
- Fix: Added check in removePostsFirstPass() to skip posts with .reddit-filter-collapse-banner
- Also cleaned up webpack.config.js: removed obsolete .txt references (now using JSON)

2026-01-24: Added options page button to popup
- Added "Advanced Settings" button between stats and account age filter sections
- Button opens options page via browser.runtime.openOptionsPage()
- Styled with neo-retro accent color (blue), uppercase text, hard shadow
- Works in both Chrome & Firefox builds

2026-01-24: Implemented filter packs system
- Created src/filter-packs.json with 6 initial packs (Politics, Sports, Crypto, Gaming, Memes, NSFW)
- Added "Packs" tab to popup with enable/disable cards
- Pack cards show name, description, keyword/subreddit counts
- Items tagged with source packId (keywordSources/subredditSources maps)
- Enabling pack merges keywords/subreddits into settings with tracking
- Disabling pack removes only items from that pack, preserves user-added items
- First-run onboarding modal lets users select packs on install
- Modal shown only once, stored in hasSeenOnboarding flag
- Neo-retro styled modal with checkboxes, Skip/Apply buttons
- Multi-pack support: can enable multiple packs simultaneously
- User can edit/delete pack items after enabling (loses pack association)

2026-01-24: Removed obsolete default JSON imports
- Removed default_keywords.json and default_subreddits.json imports from defaults.ts
- Removed KeywordData/SubredditData interfaces (no longer needed)
- Simplified defaults.ts: DEFAULT_KEYWORDS and DEFAULT_SUBREDDITS now empty arrays
- Filter packs system fully handles all default filters
- Build verified successful, no type errors

2026-01-25: Implemented pack versioning with auto-update
- Added version field (1.0.0) to all 6 packs in filter-packs.json
- Updated FilterPack interface: added version: string
- Added packVersions to FilterSettings: tracks subscribed versions per packId
- Modified enablePack(): stores pack version when user subscribes
- Created updatePackVersions(): auto-merges new items when pack version changes
- Integrated into loadSettings(): runs version check on every popup load
- Strategy: auto-update (no user action needed), preserves user edits
- Builds successful (Firefox + Chrome), no type errors
- Manual testing approach documented in learnings.md
